## Vijayanagara Empire: The Forgotten Hindu Superpower (Complete History)

In the 14th century, when much of North India was under repeated invasions and political chaos, a mighty power rose in the south—**the Vijayanagara Empire (1336–1646 CE)**.  
It became a fortress of Hindu culture, a military powerhouse, and one of the richest kingdoms the world had ever seen.

At its peak, the city of **Hampi** dazzled foreign travelers with temples of gold, markets full of diamonds, and armies that shook the Deccan.

Yet today, this empire remains strangely forgotten.

Let’s rediscover the story of the Hindu superpower that once defended and defined South India.

## 1. **The Birth of an Empire (1336 CE)**

The empire was founded by two brothers:
- **Harihara I (Hakka Raya)**  
- **Bukka Raya I**

They were guided and spiritually mentored by the saint **Vidyaranya** of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham.

### Why was Vijayanagara founded?
- To resist Islamic expansion into the south  
- To unite fragmented kingdoms  
- To protect Hindu temples and culture  
- To rebuild prosperity after years of invasions  

Thus began a new Hindu renaissance in the Deccan.

## 2. **Four Dynasties, One Great Empire**

The empire was ruled by four major lineages:

1. **Sangama Dynasty** (founders)  
2. **Saluva Dynasty**  
3. **Tuluva Dynasty** (the most powerful)  
4. **Aravidu Dynasty** (last phase)

Each added new dimensions in administration, architecture, and military strength.

## 3. **Krishnadevaraya: The Emperor Who Made Vijayanagara Invincible**

The greatest ruler of the empire was **Sri Krishnadevaraya (1509–1529 CE)** of the Tuluva dynasty.

Foreign travelers wrote that:
> “Not even Rome or Byzantium can match the greatness of Vijayanagara.”

### His achievements:
- Defeated Bahmani successors and made Deccan Sultanates bow  
- Conquered Odisha and strengthened southern coasts  
- Patronized Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Sanskrit literature  
- Built magnificent temples, irrigation networks, and fortifications  
- Maintained one of the **largest armies in the medieval world**

Krishnadevaraya’s reign is considered the **golden age** of the empire.

## 4. **Hampi: The City of Riches**

The capital city, **Vijayanagara (Hampi)**, left travelers spellbound.

### According to foreign accounts:
- Streets were lined with **pearls, rubies, sapphires**  
- Markets sold **horses, silk, spices, gold, and diamonds**  
- Palaces used **imported Chinese tiles**  
- Temples had towering **gopurams** visible miles away  
- The city stretched over **650 sq km**, one of the largest of its time  

The empire’s wealth came from:
- International trade  
- Control over the spice routes  
- Rich agriculture  
- Skilled artisans and mining

## 5. **A Military Superpower**

Vijayanagara’s army was legendary.

### It included:
- Massive cavalry  
- Infantry regiments  
- War elephants  
- Strong naval units along the east coast  
- Powerful fortresses with advanced defense systems  

They used:
- Iron-cased rockets  
- Longbows  
- Heavy cavalry armor  
- Multi-layered walls and watchtowers

Their military engineering was ahead of most medieval powers.

## 6. **A Guardian of Hindu Culture**

The empire actively protected and revived Hindu traditions.

It sponsored:
- Temple construction across the south  
- Art, dance, sculpture, and classical music  
- Vedic learning and Sanskrit scholarship  
- Festivals, rituals, and temple administration

The Chola, Pallava, and Hoysala architectural styles were blended into a unique **Vijayanagara style**.

---

## 7. **International Trade & Diplomacy**

The empire traded with:
- Portugal  
- Persia  
- Arabia  
- Southeast Asia  
- China  

Exports included spices, diamonds, silk, iron, and precious stones.

The Portuguese were amazed at the empire’s wealth and military might.

## 8. **The Battle of Talikota (1565): The Day Everything Changed**

The turning point came when the **Deccan Sultanates**—Bijapur, Golconda, Ahmadnagar, and Bidar—formed a rare alliance.

The **Battle of Talikota** ended in disaster for Vijayanagara:
- The empire’s army was betrayed from within  
- Krishnadevaraya’s successors were overpowered  
- Hampi was attacked and destroyed  
- Temples were burned, palaces looted, and the city left in ruins  

Though the empire survived in smaller form for 80 more years, it never regained its glory.

---

## 9. **Why the Empire Is Forgotten Today**

Despite its magnificence, Vijayanagara is under-remembered due to:
- Lack of written records after Hampi’s destruction  
- Political shifts in later centuries  
- Focus on northern empires in mainstream history  
- Ruins being rediscovered only in the 19th century  

Yet its legacy shaped South Indian culture profoundly.

## Conclusion: The Superpower That Should Not Be Forgotten

The Vijayanagara Empire was more than a kingdom—it was a **civilization**.

It:
- Protected Hindu culture  
- Built one of the richest cities in the world  
- Defeated powerful enemies for centuries  
- Promoted art, architecture, and literature  
- Unified South India under a stable and prosperous rule  

Its ruins at Hampi still whisper stories of a forgotten superpower that once shone brighter than most medieval kingdoms on earth.
